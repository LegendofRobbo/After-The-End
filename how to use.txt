so how does this shit work? It's simple my good chap, you simply place AfterTheEnd into your gamemodes folder (garrysmod/gamemodes)


you will need to install these addons:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247962324 (stalker playermodels for the built in armors)
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=411284648 (gamemode content pack, basically just contains zombie models and suchlike)
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448170926 (gamemode sweps pack)

WARNING: IF YOU ARE USING THE DEFAULT SWEPS PACK YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE M9K SMALL ARMS, ASSAULT RIFLES AND HEAVY WEAPONS INSTALLED
a lot of the default sweps use models and sounds from the m9k pack and will be errors if you dont have m9k installed on your server
m9k specialties is not required


===================================================================================

This gamemode requires these things three:

1. Your map must have a navmesh as the zombies are nextbots (google gmod navmesh if you dont know what this is or how to make one)

2. Your server must have counter strike source mounted

3. You need to create a config file for you map, this is literally as simple as going ingame and using these 3 commands:
ate_addzombiespawn - creates spawnpoints for the zombies to appear at
ate_addtrader - creates traders, you can type ate_refreshtraders to make them appear instantly
ate_addlootspawn - creates spawnpoints for the ingame loot caches, try to hide them well to give your players a challenge

if you mess something up you can use:
ate_clearzombiespawns
ate_cleartraderspawns
ate_clearlootspawns

a better config setup system will most likely be added in future but for now it works well enough.



Thats all!
If you have these bases covered then the gamemode should work right out of the box


===================================================================================

Adding custom content:
Adding your own items and weapons is as easy as it gets, all you need to do is edit 3 files within the gamemodes root folder.

sh_items.lua - handles all ingame items, if you aren't sure what your doing then read over the existing items and see how they work.

sh_loot.lua - loot tables, determines what can be dropped from who or where

sh_spawnables.lua - controls which props and structures are available for players to build



===================================================================================

Admin commands:

admin commands are pretty rudimentary at the moment, expect better support for admins in future
current commands are:

ate_admin_giveitem "name" "amount"          eg. zw_admin_giveitem zw_rifleammo 3       - gives you the corresponding item
ate_admin_givecash "amount" - gives you cash moneys -- edit: whoops, i had it as giveadars before which was incorrect, sorry guys

ate_admin_clearzombies "force"  - deletes all regular zombies if force is false or not inputted, deletes all nextbots including bosses if you type force after the command
